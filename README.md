# MachineLearning_Project

FYS-4155

This repository contains code for a Machine Learning model, specifically running Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge and LASSO regression.

The 'project1_main.py' file is where the script is run from.

'additional_functions_project1.py' contains extra function and most importantly the benchmark function for looping through instances of the model class.

'Poly2DFit.py' is a class which contains all the functions for creating a Machine Learning model.

'plotting_functions.py' is a file for plotting the output data in various ways.

'functions_test.py' is a file for running testing.

'plotting_heatmaps.py' is a file for plotting heatmaps (this is manually executed after the main script)

The folder 'Results' contains the data and plots from the models of the Franke Function.

Folder 'Terrain data' contains the orginal images tif files which are to modelled.

Folder 'yellowstone1_36_scale' and 'yellowstone1_6_scale' contains the data and plots of the Terrain data models, with the reduced scale of 36 and 6 respectively.
